# Manage data with json files in lightweight way

## Decision

Since the problem requires just read-only data and doesn't require complex queries we decided to go with 
a lightweight Gem to manage stored data through json. Json allows us to keep the data inside the repo
and doesn't force us to have to manage/install a separated database management system, simplifying a lot 
the solution and allowing us to focus on what really matters by now.
 
Besides, all the queries required by the problem are done by id, so this Gem, Ruson, seems to be a elegant
solution for searching Jsons with O(1) complexity. Last, but not least, the way the code is written
allows us to easily move from this to a more complex and complete document-oriented database if necessary,
following principles of [Building Evolutionary Architectures](https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/building-evolutionary-architectures).
