# Use Node as the gRPC client

## Decision

Decided for Node as gRPC server since it has a light syntaxe, it has a clear example in the oficial gRPC documentation and because the "team" (only me) has some knowledge with it, so are a leaving the learning curve for the gRPC only. We may change our mind, but for now this is the idea.
